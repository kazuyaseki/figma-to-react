## The Problem

Many Figma to Code tools have one or more problems of the followings:

- generates for whole Figma file(not by component)
- need to go outside of Figma to visit service's site
- layout style is not responsive, and is absolute positioned to its parent

## Solution

Figma to React Component outputs React code in the plugin UI and can be generated by selecting certain node.
And its style is derived from Auto Layout properties, thus is responsive.

`buildTagTree` method would be useful for such case.
`buildTagTree` method outputs a `tag` object in the following format which is independent from how the final outcome is structured.

```ts
export type Tag = {
  name: string
  isText: boolean
  textCharacters: string | null
  isImg: boolean
  properties: Property[]
  css: CSSData
  children: Tag[]
}
```
